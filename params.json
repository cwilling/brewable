  "body": "### What is brewable?\r\nBrewable is software for the Raspberry Pi, enabling it to read temperature information from directly connected sensors and programmatically activate relays to control heating and/or cooling equipment. A main point of difference to other similar software is that direct keyboard, mouse and screen access to the Raspberry Pi is not required to run the software; it is run remotely via a browser. This enables the Raspberry Pi and associated hardware (relays etc.) to be packaged into a box and tucked away somewhere safe without need for physical access to it.\r\n\r\n### Software Installation\r\nThese instructions are based on a standard Raspbian based system, although other systems should work without great effort since nothing esoteric is required to install and run the software. It is assumed you have a Raspberry Pi up and running, including wired or wireless networking. It is highly recommended that the Raspberry Pi uses a static IP address or that its DHCP server (probably your modem/router) is configured to always allocate the same IP address to the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
