<p>Brewable is software for the Raspberry Pi, enabling it to read temperature information from directly connected sensors and programmatically activate relays to control heating and/or cooling equipment. A main point of difference to other similar software is that direct keyboard, mouse and screen access to the Raspberry Pi is not required to run the software; it is run remotely via a browser. This enables the Raspberry Pi and associated hardware (relays etc.) to be packaged into a box and tucked away somewhere safe without further need for physical access to it.</p>

<h3>
<a id="software-installation" class="anchor" href="#software-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software Installation</h3>

<p>These instructions are based on a standard Raspbian based system, although other systems should work without great effort since nothing esoteric is required to install and run the software. It is assumed you have a Raspberry Pi up and running, including wired or wireless networking. It is highly recommended that the Raspberry Pi uses a static IP address or that its DHCP server (probably your modem/router) is configured to always allocate the same IP address to the Raspberry Pi. Make a note of the IP address.</p>
<p>Since Raspbian enables the ssh server by default, the installation itself can be performed
either remotely, using any ssh client program (e.g. 'ssh' on Linux & Mac, Putty on Windows), or directly
on the Raspberry Pi using keyboard, mouse & display if they're still connected. If installing remotely,
connect with ssh or putty to the Raspberry Pi at its previously noted IP address. If installing directly,
open a Terminal window. In either case, run the following commands:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>wget https://github.com/cwilling/brewable/archive/0.1.tar.gz</code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xf 0.1.tar.gz</code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>cd brewable-0.1</code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sudo make install</code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sudo update-rc.d brewable defaults</code>
</p>
